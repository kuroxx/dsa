## Tips from mock interviewer

1. Grind questions by topic
   - know topics well with template

2. Grind questions randomly 
   - know how to tackle unseen questions

- Solve medium problems within 20-15min
- Do Leetcode daily problems and score within 10%

- Always start with brute force solution
- Voice if you're stuck
- Write down notes / constraints


# Top coding patterns for FAANG interviews

| Pattern                                                                                  | Notes                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Two pointers (Arrays, Strings, Fast & Slow Pointer)                                      | Covers large set of q's related to Arrays & Strings (highesttagged DS). Fast & slow pointer easy variation of 2-pointer pattern. |
| Sliding window (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables)                                            | covers most of the problems related to top data structures like Arrays, Strings, and HashTables.                                 |
| Tree and Graph Depth First Search (Matrix Traversal)                                     | Most Trees and Graphs problems can be solved using Depth First Search (DFS). Matrix Traversal, which is also DFS based pattern, covers most of the matrix-related problems. | 
| Tree and Graph Breadth First Search (Queue, Subsets, Matrix Traversal, Topological Sort) | Breadth First Search (BFS) is a very handy pattern. BFS patterns like Subsets, Matrix Traversal, and Topological Sort cover a good number of problems. |
| Binary Search (Arrays)                                                                   | Binary Search and its variants are used to solve a huge number of coding questions. |
| Interval Merge                                                                           |  Although there are not many problems related to Interval Merge, these problems frequently appear in coding interviews. | 
| Recursion/Backtracking                                                                   | Backtracking and recursion are used to solve a wide range of problems. Mastering these techniques is highly recommended. |
